### Explanation of the Folder Structure

#### **1. `constants/`**
- Stores all constants (e.g., colors, sizes, text, and image references) for centralized management.
- Makes it easy to modify shared data like themes and assets without searching across multiple files.

#### **2. `features/`**
- Organized into separate folders for each feature, ensuring modularity and scalability.
- Each feature folder contains:
  - **`controllers/`**: Handles business logic and state management for the feature.
  - **`models/`**: Defines the data structure for the feature.
  - **`screen/`**: Contains UI components specific to the feature.

#### **3. `repository/`**
- Provides a layer of abstraction between the application's business logic and the data source (Firestore).
- Ensures clean separation of concerns and reusability of data management code.
- Example: `attandance_repo.dart` manages CRUD operations for attandance.

#### **4. `utils/`**
- Contains reusable utilities like app-wide themes or helper functions.
- Example: `theme/` manages colors, fonts, and other design-related configurations.

#### **5. Core Files**
- `firebase_options.dart`: Stores Firebase configuration to connect the app to Firebase services (e.g., Firestore, Authentication).
- `main.dart`: The entry point of the Flutter application, initializing Firebase and loading the main widget.

### Benefits of MVC + Repository Pattern

1. **Maintainability**:
   - Modular folders make it easier to locate and update specific features or components.
   - Isolated layers (e.g., controller, repository) minimize code conflicts during team collaboration.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Adding new features requires creating a new folder under `features/` without affecting existing code.

3. **Reusability**:
   - Repository functions (e.g., CRUD operations) can be reused across different parts of the application.

4. **Debugging Simplicity**:
   - Errors are easy to trace since the responsibilities of controllers, repositories, and views are clearly separated.

### Example Data Flow
**Use Case: Adding a New Announcement**

1. **UI (`screen/event/event.dart`)**:
   - The user can see list of the event

2. **Controller (`controller/attandance_repo.dart`)**:
   - Validates the user input and calls the repository to save the data to Firestore.

3. **Repository (`repository/attandance_controller.dart`)**:
   - Sends the data to Firestore via Firebase APIs.

4. **Firestore**:
   - Stores the announcement data and sends a response back to the app.

### Debugging Tips

- Run `flutter doctor` to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
- Check the device logs using:
  ```bash
  flutter logs
  ```
- Use `flutter clean` to clear cached data if you encounter unexpected behavior.
